# Implementation-of-Personal-Fitness-Tracker-using-Python

The Personal Fitness Tracker is a machine learning-powered web application developed using Python and Streamlit, designed to provide personalized calorie burn predictions based on user-specific parameters such as age, BMI, exercise duration, heart rate, body temperature, and gender. Unlike generic fitness apps, this system leverages a Random Forest Regression model trained on real-world datasets (exercise.csv and calories.csv) to deliver accurate, data-driven insights without the need for wearable devices. The application features an intuitive user interface where users can input their fitness metrics and receive instant feedback on their estimated calorie expenditure, along with comparative analytics that highlight how their data aligns with trends in the dataset. By bridging the gap between AI and fitness, this project promotes informed decision-making for healthier lifestyles and sets the foundation for future enhancements such as wearable integration, deep learning implementation, mobile deployment, and personalized diet recommendations.
